# Custom CNN Architecture for Image Classification

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture inspired by MobileNet, ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3, and Xception. The goal is to design a lightweight yet powerful model from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras, combining the strengths of these popular CNN designs for effective image classification.
